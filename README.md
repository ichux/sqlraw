## SQLRAW

This project intends to help anyone make use of raw sql queries in while building applications of any magnitude
and in any programming language. It decouples anyone from being tied to any framework of choice.

#Supported databases:
For now, PostgreSQL and MySQL are supported and there are plans to help it grow into a larger project that will cater
to the other databases out there, like SQLite, etc.

# How to run
1. Check to see the files, mysql_init.sh or psql_init.sh for choice variables.
2. Some assumptions are made where necessary such that even if you do not fill the variables, it will still work
